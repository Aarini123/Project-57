                <h2 id="code2">Drawing plays a big role in our development. It can help us learn to write and think creatively, develop hand-eye coordination, hone analytic skills, and conceptualise ideas. But drawing is rarely used as a tool for learning in schools.

                    Image result for why drawing is good for us
In addition to creativity, there are different benefits to drawing. We use our brains when we draw, and this not only releases endorphins, but helps build new connections and pathways. When drawing, we actively use both sides of our brain, the right for creativity, and the left for logical thinking.
